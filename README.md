# dpaster-sublime

This is a plugin for Sublime Text editor that interfaces with dpaste.org. It was written for my own needs but I thought others could make use of it, too.

### Installation

```sh
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
git clone http://github.com/adder46/dpaster-sublime.git
```

### Usage

Select the text, right click (Context menu) -> Upload to dpaste
Alternatively, you can use a shortcut: `CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + D`.

**NOTE**: To add more lexers, simply edit the `application.py` file (`LEXERS`).
